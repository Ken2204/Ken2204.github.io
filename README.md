This project demonstrates [How Ai is impacting 3D animation](file:///C:/Users/Kennedy/Downloads/How%20Ai%20is%20impacting%203D%20animation%20%20(1).html) Through the use of flow charts and facts. 
For this project I really wanted it to feel both interactive, while also being educational. The biggest challange I had was making sure the writing was able to be understood. All the while trying to make sure it connected to other parts of the flow chart. I was able to do this by really focusing less on the essay aspect, but more on the coding. 

## Character Creation
This was one of my first ever time coding. I am very proud of how this turned out. I hope I can still improve from here.

I really struggled with the "scar", or the triangle. I really wanted to figure out a specific style and location for it. After some trial and error I was able to get it in the spot I wanted. I was very proud. 

## Flow Chart 
This is a flow chart about the choices one makes on the way from Union station

What I struggled with was importing the images. I evntually was able to do it. The images really elevated the experience. 

## Duck Game
This is a iomage of the duck game I created! It turned out so cute.

The challange with this project was once again importing images. No duck image fix. So eventually I just made my own. I still would like to eventually figure out how to make it so its more of a memory game, than random guessing one. But that is a later task.

## Website WIP 
THis my future website for my art portfolio I hope to make over the course of next semester. It is not yet completed But I am excited for where and how it evolves.

I am gonna hopefully make it interactive later on. I really want to make this portfolio pop.
